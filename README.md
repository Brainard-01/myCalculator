# 🧮 Simple Calculator

Welcome to the **Simple Calculator** project! This calculator is a lightweight web application built using **JavaScript**. It handles both **basic arithmetic operations** and **trigonometric functions**. Whether you need to add, subtract, or calculate the sine of an angle, this calculator has you covered!



## 🚀 Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
  
- **Trigonometric Functions**:
  - Sine (sin) 📐
  - Cosine (cos) 🌐
  - Tangent (tan) ⏳

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The core language behind the calculator's logic.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For building the user interface.
- **Math.js**: Used for handling more advanced mathematical functions.

## 🖥️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

That's it! 🎉 You can now start calculating.

## 🔢 Usage

### Arithmetic Calculations
Simply click the numeric buttons to input values and use the operator buttons to perform calculations. Example:
2 + 2 = 4


### Trigonometric Functions
You can calculate angles (in radians or degrees) using the `sin`, `cos`, and `tan` functions. Example:
sin(45) = 0.707
